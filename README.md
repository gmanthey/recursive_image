# Recursive Image

A program to generate a image using multiple images as pixels. Inspired by a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/ennw4u/the_xkcd_logo_made_out_of_the_comics/).

## Requirements

 - python (version 3 or higher)
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - opencv

## Installation

 Just install the required software and download the two .py files.  
 If the installation of opencv is concidered to difficult, there is also a [seperate branch](https://github.com/gmanthey/recursive_image/tree/PIL) in which pillow, a python library is used. As it gives worse results than opencv, the main branch is kept using opencv.

## Usage

Execute the recursive_image.py file in a terminal with python and you should get a help text if everything is going right.
